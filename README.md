<h1>‚ùì Purpose of the project:</h1>

<div>
    <p>
        This project aims to develop a Telegram bot that automates the interaction between humans and computers, aligning with the objectives of the Human-Computer Interaction discipline. Through a natural interface, users communicate with the bot via Telegram, which then performs searches on real estate websites such as QuintoAndar and Chaves na M√£o.
        <br><br>
        The bot uses Selenium to navigate these websites and filter results based on user-specified criteria, such as rental or sale, type of property, and price range. This approach transforms natural language into automated actions, showcasing the application of advanced AI models like those discussed in class.
        <br><br>
        Beyond a simple chatbot, this project creates an intelligent agent capable of handling complex tasks, such as searching for properties across multiple websites simultaneously and returning results directly in the Telegram chat. The user saves time and avoids the manual process of visiting and searching through multiple sites.

    <h1>‚úîÔ∏è Features:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Property Search: Automates searches on QuintoAndar and Chaves na M√£o for rentals or sales.</li>
        <li>Custom Filters: Supports filtering by type of property, price range, and other criteria.</li>
        <li>Real-Time Interaction: Communicates directly with the user via Telegram chat.</li>
        <li>Streamlined Workflow: Simplifies the property search process by aggregating results in one place.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>ü§ñ The Process:</h1>
    <p>
        Developing this Telegram bot involved several key steps, including understanding the Telegram Bot API, integrating Selenium for web automation, and managing user inputs effectively. The process highlighted the importance of bridging user requirements with automated systems.
        <br><br>
        Challenges included designing robust navigation scripts for real estate websites and handling dynamic content loading. Overcoming these challenges required deep dives into Selenium, error handling strategies, and testing on various scenarios to ensure reliability.
        <br><br>
        This iterative development process reinforced the project's alignment with the discipline's goal of creating efficient human-computer interaction systems.
